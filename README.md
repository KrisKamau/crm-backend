**crm-backend**
======
This is a small backend I made to learn about creating simple RESTful APIs using Node, Express and Postman.
I also use Babel to transpile the code as I'm using ES6 syntax here, as well as Mongo as a database and Mongoose as an ODM.


## Usage
```$ git clone https://github.com/KrisKamau/crm-backend.git
